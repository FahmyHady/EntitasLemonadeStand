Match One is a very simple CandyCrush-like Match 3 example, except it's Match One.

[Watch the talk from Unite Europe 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvMXur19M4) to get an in-depth tutorial.

Match One shows
- systems list in `GameController`
- how you can use reactive systems to only process changed entities
- the usage of `EntityIndex` for super fast entity access
- how you can use multiple `contexts` to reduce the memory footprint of each entity (Game, Input, GameState, Config)
